# Build & Bundling

### SWC

##### Dependencies

- @swc/cli
- @swc/core

##### Info

- Building with swc only transpiles .ts to .js, it does not buldle your code.
- If you are olny using swc to transpile then you need node_moduels to run you build file.

### NCC

##### Dependencies

- @vercel/ncc

##### Info

- If you are using ncc, then it transpiles and then buldles your code (using webpack).
- So you don't need node_modules to run your build file.
- A single index.js file is created, that contains all your code, just run that.
- In this project some prisma dependencies (\*.node) which cannot be bundled, is also required to run the build file, so make sure to copy those as well.

### Prisma

- build > bundling > ./node_modules/.prisma/client/<os_specific_node_files>
- After building and bundling you code, you need to have the .node files which are platform independent files which prisma requires to run.
- Copy those files and put it in the root directory where you root.js file is generated, in this case the file is index.js.
